Title: Advanced Python Mini Project Proposal: Developing an Interactive Doom-like Game with NPCs using Pygame

Abstract:
The aim of this project is to develop an interactive and engaging video game reminiscent of the classic Doom, integrating non-player characters (NPCs) within the game environment. This project will be implemented in Python using the Pygame library, leveraging its powerful features for graphics and game development. While incorporating concepts from existing tutorials and resources, this project will emphasize creativity, problem-solving, and a deep understanding of game mechanics to deliver a polished and entertaining gaming experience. All this sounds very fancy but its basically cause funny lmao.

Introduction:
The gaming industry continues to thrive, with an ever-growing demand for immersive and captivating gameplay experiences. Inspired by the iconic Doom series, this project seeks to create a Python-based game that combines fast-paced action with dynamic NPC interactions. By leveraging the Pygame library, we aim to harness its extensive capabilities in graphics rendering, event handling, and sound management to bring our game concept to life.
